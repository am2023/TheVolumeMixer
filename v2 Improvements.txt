**** Success Criteria ****

Want longer and less square -- more rectangular

Double or so space between pots so you don't accidentally knock others

Maybe go to 7 or LEDs now that have more space *

Do audio over I2S if possible *

Isolate audio portion of circuit from the digital (major ground loop interference) *

Just go crystalless (re-attempting crystal)

Mute button for each channel (maybe built into pots)

Mute button for speakers w/ LED indication
