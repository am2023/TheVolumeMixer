Required Hardware / Software
	- need JLink/JLink Edu/ ST-Link v2
	- need Adafruit Adalink repo OR Atmel Studio with JLink
	- need uf2_samdx microsoft repo for building bootloader

Get bootloader from uf2-samdx github repo
	- Edit board.config file for Metro M0 and add "#define CRYSTALLESS 1" to the headers
	- Make the bootloader by going to root directory and running "make BOARD=metro_m0"
	- copy the bootloader.bin file into adalink folder for flashing

Flashing
	- Connect SWDIO, SWCLK, GND, and Reset for ST-Link v2
	- Connect Vref to 3.3V if using JLink
	- run "adalink atsamd21g18 -p stlink -w -b [bootloader.bin file] 0"
		- replace stlink with jlink if using jlink
	- OR can use Atmel studio if using Jlink
	
Sketches
	- if running crystalless, make sure to add -DCRYSTALLESS to boards.txt file in Arduino for the Metro M0
